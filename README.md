The analysis follows a structured data lifecycle: loading and merging datasets, cleaning and preprocessing the data, and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to extract actionable insights through visualizations and statistics. Key areas of focus include skills landscape, job distribution by location, the rise of remote work, and company hiring trends.
